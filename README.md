# Unity-projects
These are the 2 main Unity projects which i worked on. These projects were a part of my 3D gaming class.
Airball - A 2d game designed by me in unity which allows user to control the ball and make it through the finish line by overcoming the obstacles. 
Portal 3 - Similar to portal 2, Portal 3 was a group project of 4 people. The game allows the player to shoot portals which allow the character to go through them and complete the maze puzzle
